# HexSoftwares_Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-on-a-Public-Dataset.
This repository contains my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the Titanic dataset for the HexSoftwares Data Science Internship. The project includes data cleaning, handling missing values, visualizations, and insights on factors affecting passenger survival.
The goal of this project is to analyze the Titanic dataset to discover patterns and factors that influenced passenger survival. The project includes data cleaning, preprocessing, visual exploration, and insight generation.

## Project Objectives
Load and explore the Titanic dataset
Clean and preprocess data
Handle missing values
Perform statistical analysis
Visualize distributions and relationships
Identify survival patterns based on:
Sex
Passenger class
Age
Fare
Embarked location

## Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

## Key Steps Performed
### 1. Data Loading
Imported the Titanic CSV dataset and reviewed basic structure.
### 2. Data Cleaning
Filled missing Age values with median
Filled missing Embarked values with mode
Dropped Cabin due to heavy missing data
Converted appropriate columns into categorical types
### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Univariate analysis (Age, Fare, Pclass, Sex)
Bivariate analysis (Survival by Gender, Class, Age, Fare)
Correlation heatmap
Visualizations to interpret survival patterns
### 4. Insights
Females had a higher survival rate
First-class passengers survived more
Younger passengers had better chances
Higher fares correlated with survival
